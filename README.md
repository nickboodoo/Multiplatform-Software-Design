The Gaming Room is a mobile application game developer launching a competitive puzzle game on Android. The client wanted to develop a web-based version of their game so that it could be cross-platform.
I think that I took a lot of time in writing the recommendation section since I had spent a lot of time studying that. In my oninion, I did a particularly good job of suggesting a cloud based approach for their application. 
I think that it was helpful to analyze the UML diagram to get a good understanding of the project. This allowed me to understand how everything should be working together and the most efficient way.
I think that if anyting, the evaluation section which compare and contrasts the different operating systems could be revised to be way more specific. I would probably make them as detailed as possible instead of just getting the general idea. 
It is important to understand why this program is being created. The key needs of the client are very important beacuse they are expecting a certain end result. End user usability is extremely important. End user needs and requirements are the most imporant factor to consider in developing an application since they will be the ones using the application.
In order to design the software, I started out with a general idea which then slowly progressed. Using the end user needs, a list of requirements can be used as a structure on what the application needs to accomplish.
